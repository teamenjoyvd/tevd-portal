## Constants

| | |
|---|---|
| Repo | `teamenjoyvd/tevd-portal` |
| Branch | `main` |
| Supabase project | `ynykjpnetfwqzdnsgkkg` |
| Production URL | `https://tevd-portal.vercel.app` |

Never ask the user to confirm these.

---

## ID Format

```
[YYMM]-[TYPE]-[GH#]
```

- `YYMM` — year + month of creation (e.g. `2604` for April 2026)
- `TYPE` — `FEAT`, `BUG`, or `CHORE`
- `GH#` — the GitHub issue number assigned when the issue is created (no padding)

Examples: `2604-FEAT-61`, `2604-BUG-54`, `2604-CHORE-66`

| Artifact | Format |
|---|---|
| GitHub Issue title | `[2604-FEAT-61] Short description` |
| Branch | `feature/2604-FEAT-61` |
| Commit prefix | `[2604-FEAT-61] description` |
| PR title | `[2604-FEAT-61] description` |

The GitHub issue number is the canonical unique identifier. It is assigned atomically by GitHub — no counter to maintain, no inference required. Never check existing issue numbers and increment — always create the issue and read the number from the response.

---

## GitHub Issue Labels

| Label | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `feat` | New functionality |
| `bug` | Something broken |
| `chore` | Refactor, deps, infrastructure |
| `priority:high` | Pick before anything else |
| `priority:low` | Pick last |
| `blocked` | Do not pick — has a dependency that isn't resolved |

READ order: `priority:high` first, then unlabelled, then `priority:low`. Never pick a `blocked` issue without explicit user acknowledgment.

---

## Hard Constraints

Violation = immediate stop, no exceptions.

- **NEVER push directly to `main`.** Feature branches only: `feature/[YYMM]-[TYPE]-[GH#]`.
- **NEVER create `middleware.ts`.** Auth lives in `proxy.ts`.
- **NEVER expose `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to the client.**
- **NEVER bypass Clerk auth on a protected route.**
- **NEVER mark Done on static analysis alone.** Vercel PR preview must be READY and CI green.
- **NEVER write data to Supabase from a Preview URL** — preview URLs hit production DB.
- **390px mobile-first.** Every new UI surface must render correctly at 390px.
- **RLS policies use Pattern A helpers only** — `is_admin()`, `get_my_role()`, `get_my_profile_id()`, `get_my_clerk_id()`. Never raw `auth.jwt()`.
- **shadcn/ui for all interactive primitives** — dialog, popover, dropdown, sheet, tooltip, select, combobox, alert dialog.
- **Component co-location** — new components scoped to one route go in `app/[route]/components/`. Promote to `/components` only when used by 2+ unrelated routes.
- **Dual layout law** — NEVER a single responsive layout. Two complete separate layouts only. Canonical ref: `app/(dashboard)/about/page.tsx`.
- **NEVER call `create_or_update_file` or `push_files` before PLAN's CLAIM is complete.** No file writes until the feature branch exists and is confirmed.
- **PLAN and BUILD are mutually exclusive within a session.** PLAN does no file writes. BUILD does no PLAN-mode design work. Violation = immediate stop.

---

## Commands

**SSU** — System Status Update. Run at session start:

1. **Tool warm-up (before anything else):**
   - `tool_search("get file contents github")`
   - `tool_search("branch issue pull request create")`
   Confirm both return results. If either fails — stop.

2. `get_file_contents` on `CLAUDE.md` — confirms GitHub connectivity and loads current state.

3. `list_pull_requests` — check for any open PRs.
   - **Open PR found:** read its `## Session State` block and report what's in flight before doing anything else.
   - **No open PR, but a PLAN-complete issue exists** (has `## Branch` block, no PR): report as CLAIM-complete/EXECUTE-not-started → proceed to GATHER in BUILD.
   - **Nothing in flight:** report ready to pick up next issue.

Output format:
```
| GitHub    | ✅/❌ |
| In flight | [YYMM]-[TYPE]-[GH#] <title> / None |
| Handoff   | IN PROGRESS: <next action> / DONE / PLAN-complete: ready for GATHER / No active PR |
```
If GitHub ❌ — stop.

**PIU** — Pack It Up. Run at session end:
1. Confirm PR `## Session State` is `DONE` — write it now if not already done.
2. If REF.md needs updates (schema changed, new routes, new env vars) — update and push in a single `push_files` call together with any other changed docs.
3. If nothing changed in REF.md — done. No other writes required.

**GCR** — Address Gemini Code Review. See `docs/ai/GCR.md`.

**PLAN** — Enter design-only mode for this session.

Prefix the session with `PLAN` to enter this mode.

- For each issue in the batch:
  1. Read relevant REF.md / FLOWS.md sections freely — no competing write budget.
  2. Produce a DoD as **specific verifiable checklist items with file paths**, not directional statements. Example:
     ```
     ## DoD
     - [ ] `app/[route]/components/X.tsx` renders without overflow at 390px
     - [ ] `api/y/route.ts` returns 403 for non-admin Clerk userId
     ```
  3. Output a verdict: **READY** or **BLOCKED: [single specific question]**.
  4. If BLOCKED:
     - `create_issue` with title (no ID yet), body with DoD and blocked status.
     - Read `GH#` from response. Rename title to `[YYMM-TYPE-GH#] description`.
     - Apply `blocked` label.
     - Write `## Blocking Unknown` section to the issue body with the single question.
     - Stop processing dependent tickets.
     - Re-entry: user resolves the question → re-run `PLAN` scoped to that ticket → READY or new BLOCKED.
  5. If READY — **CLAIM:**
     1. `create_issue` — title (no ID yet), body with DoD and Design Checklist (all items checked).
     2. Read `GH#` from the response — this is the canonical identifier.
     3. `update_issue` — rename title to `[YYMM-TYPE-GH#] description`.
     4. `create_branch` → `feature/[YYMM]-[TYPE]-[GH#]` from `main`.
     5. Confirm branch exists (check the returned ref).
     6. **HARD GATE: if branch creation fails — comment `BLOCKED: branch creation failed` on the issue, apply `blocked` label, STOP. Do not proceed.**
     7. `update_issue` — write `## Branch` followed by a newline and `` `feature/[YYMM]-[TYPE]-[GH#]` `` into the issue body.

Permitted writes: GitHub issue creation, issue body, branch creation.
Forbidden: `create_or_update_file`, `push_files`.

---

## DESIGN-Complete Definition

An issue is DESIGN-complete when its body contains:
1. A `## Design Checklist` section with all four items checked.
2. A `## Branch` section with the feature branch name.

```
## Design Checklist
- [x] DoD defined (specific, file-path-level)
- [x] Affected files listed by path
- [x] Gotchas flagged against Gotchas table
- [x] Blocking unknowns: none

## Branch
`feature/YYMM-TYPE-GH#`
```

This is the gate between PLAN and BUILD. BUILD mode verifies both at SSU. If either section is absent or any checklist item is unchecked, BUILD refuses and states exactly what is missing.

---

## BUILD Workflow

**Precondition (SSU):** Read the issue body. Verify `## Design Checklist` exists with all four items checked AND `## Branch` exists with the branch name. If either is absent or incomplete — stop, state exactly what is missing, do not proceed.

**READ** → Check open GitHub Issues. Resume any in-progress issue (open PR exists). If a PLAN-complete issue has no open PR, that is the next issue to pick up — read the `## Branch` value from its body and proceed to GATHER. Otherwise pick the highest `priority:high` open issue without the `blocked` label. If none, pick the next unlabelled issue by creation order.

**SHAPE (read-only)** → Verify the DoD from the issue body is still coherent against the current codebase state. Read any relevant architecture doc:
   - Auth / role / Clerk sync → `FLOWS.md §1`
   - Registration → `FLOWS.md §2`
   - Payments → `FLOWS.md §3`
   - LOS / tree / notifications → `FLOWS.md §4`
   - Vital signs → `FLOWS.md §5`
   - New external dependency → update `C4.md` first
   - New architectural pattern → write ADR in `DECISIONS.md` before executing

   If DoD is stale or wrong: stop and request user to update the issue body before proceeding.
   **No writes (including issue body) in SHAPE.**

**GATHER** → Read only the REF.md sections the ticket needs (section map at top of REF.md).

**EXECUTE** → Change only lines required by DoD. All writes target the feature branch only. Push to trigger Vercel Preview.
- Before any large task (>100 lines): write `IN PROGRESS` to PR `## Session State` first, then commit a skeleton with `// TODO:` items before implementing.

**VERIFY** → DoD point-by-point. Vercel Preview READY. CI green. 390px check. No production side-effects.

**FINALIZE** → Mark PR ready for review. User merges manually via GitHub UI. After merge: confirm production Vercel deployment READY. Issue closes automatically via `Closes #N` in PR body.

### PR Session State block

The PR description is the sole handoff document.

```markdown
## Session State
**Status:** IN PROGRESS | DONE
**Completed:**
- [x] done thing
**Next:** single specific action for incoming instance
```

Write `IN PROGRESS` before starting a large task. Write `DONE` after verifying. If OOT hits mid-task, the skeleton commit is the fallback — it must exist before implementation begins.

## Gotchas

| Topic | Rule |
|---|---|
| `middleware.ts` | NEVER. Use `proxy.ts`. |
| Clerk auth | `await auth()` → `{ userId }`. No sync auth. No JWT template. |
| Clerk shadow DOM | CSS vars unavailable in Clerk components. Use hardcoded hex (`#bc4749`). |
| Role promotion | Every `profiles.role` update MUST also call `clerk.users.updateUserMetadata`. Routes: `/api/admin/verify`, `/api/admin/members/[id]` PATCH, `/api/admin/members/verify/[id]`. |
| `payments` FK | Two FKs to `profiles`. PostgREST MUST use `profiles!profile_id(...)` — without it, 500. |
| `types/supabase.ts` | Regenerate via `Supabase:generate_typescript_types` MCP only — CLI not installed. |
| Supabase DDL | `apply_migration` only. Never raw `execute_sql` for DDL. Always save to `supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDDNNNNNN_name.sql`. |
| Large GitHub files | `create_or_update_file` times out above ~10KB. Use `push_files`. |
| Mapbox | CDN only — never npm. Dupe guard on load. |
| Mapbox theme swap | `map.setStyle()` + `styledata` event. MutationObserver on `data-theme`. |
| shadcn install | NEVER `npx shadcn@latest init` — corrupts globals.css. Use `npx shadcn@latest add <n>`. After each add, revert any injected `@layer base` blocks. |
| shadcn CSS vars | Edit vended source in `components/ui/` to use project tokens (`--bg-card`, `--text-primary`) not shadcn defaults. |
| shadcn Tabs | NEVER `defaultValue`. Always `value={tab}` + `onValueChange` → `router.replace(?tab=..., { scroll: false })`. Wrap in `<Suspense>`. |
| `--bg-global-rgb` dark | MUST be `26, 31, 24`. Wrong value = white navbar in dark mode. |
| Admin forms | NEVER define a form component inside a parent page component — React remounts on every render. Hoist to module scope. |
| Admin Drawer | Use `components/ui/Drawer.tsx` for all admin create/edit. Exceptions: Announcements + Quick Links create = inline cards. All deletes use `AlertDialog`. |
| Route handler `params` | `params` is a `Promise` in Next.js 16. Type as `{ params: Promise<{ id: string }> }` and `await params`. |
| `useParams()` | Takes NO type argument in Next.js 16. `const params = useParams(); const id = params.id as string`. |
| `sendEmail` | Removed. Use `sendNotificationEmail` (fire-and-forget, respects config gates) or `sendTransactionalEmail` (bypasses gates, returns typed result). **Dynamic imports evade static rename tools and grep** — after any email-related rename, manually read every route using `import('@/lib/email/send')`. Known callers in `sendNotificationEmail` JSDoc. |
| `pg_net` cron | `net.http_post(...)`. NEVER `extensions.http_post(...)` — silently does nothing. |
| `TranslationKey` | Strict union. Add to `translations.ts` before using `t()` or build breaks. |
| `BottomNav.tsx` | Dead stub. Do not import. |
| Profile prerender | Guard ALL `validProfile!` accesses with `if (isLoading \|\| !validProfile) return <ProfileSkeleton />`. |
| `TeamAttendee` type | Exported from `app/(dashboard)/trips/[id]/page.tsx`. Do not redeclare. |

## When This File Is Wrong

If any instruction contradicts Next.js 16 / Clerk v7 / Supabase current SDK behaviour — stop, state the contradiction, cite correct behaviour, ask for a decision.
